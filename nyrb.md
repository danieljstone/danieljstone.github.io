## **Six Decades of the New York Review of Books: By the Numbers** 

 

### **Abstract**

 

Since its founding in 1963, the New York Review of Books has occupied a position of special cultural and intellectual prominence in the United States. Its roster of regular contributors has included many of the most important writers and scholars of the past six decades.

 

The NYRB’s significance as an intellectual nexus has also earned it its fair share of critics. They have leveled various complaints against the NYRB: that it is insular and self-dealing, it is overly-male, it is overly-academic, has failed to foster new writers, and has favored certain publishers.

 

A statistical review of fifty-seven years of the NYRB’s review metadata, beginning with the inaugural February 3, 1963 issue and ending with the August 2020 issue—spanning some 16,331 reviews and 1,194 issues—permits quantitative evaluation of these criticisms. It also provided greater definition to what otherwise might be impressionistic descriptions of the NYRB’s editorial trajectory over the years.

 

Perhaps most significantly for current readers, in recent years these trends have markedly changed, partly coinciding with the arrival of new and younger editors.

 

### The New York Review of (“Each Other’s”) Books

One line of criticism of the NYRB is that it has been especially inward-looking—that its writers have primarily reviewed themselves, leading Richard Hofstadter to coin the term the “New York Review of Each Other’s Books.” [[2\]](#_ftn2)

 

Depending on where one draws this line, a significant proportion of books reviewed in the NYRB have been written by contributors. An even greater proportion of contributors have had their own books reviewed in the NYRB. 

 

*Reviewed Books Written by NYRB Contributors*

 

There are two ways of counting the number of NYRB reviews of books written by NYRB contributors. The first is more restrictive: looking at a given book review, we can ask whether the author of a book ever *previously* contributed to the NYRB. However, this narrow counting raises complications, especially looking at the early years of the NYRB. By definition, looking at the first issue of the NYRB, there were no *previous* contributors to the NYRB. Therefore, a second, looser, way of counting is also helpful: looking at a given book review, we can ask if a book’s author *ever* contributed to the NYRB.

 

By the first and more restrictive measure, a reader would find that over time more than one in four (26.8%) of the reviews appearing in the NYRB reviewed books written by writers the reader previously saw contribute to the NYRB. By the second and looser measure, over a third (36.8%) of reviews have reviewed books by NYRB contributors past and present. 

 

Considering these proportions calculated on an annual basis illustrates the value of the more inclusive measure. The contributor list was necessarily small in the first year of the NYRB’s publication, but many writers of books reviewed in 1963 came to be contributors themselves (34%).[[3\]](#_ftn3)  I prefer the more restrictive metric, however, because it better reflects how readers actually perceive the *Review*. 

 

It is clear from the figure below that the 1990s were a period when the NYRB especially looked towards familiar names (notably 88% of book reviews in the February 16, 1995 issue were written by past contributors). It is also clear that in recent years the NYRB has increasingly reviewed new authors, i.e. persons who were not its past contributors.

*Contributors have their own books reviewed*

 

More than half, or 52.6%, of NYRB contributors have had books that they have written reviewed in the NYRB. Specifically, 37.5% of contributors who have written just one article have had a book they have written reviewed and 64.4% of contributors who have written two or more articles for the NYRB have had their books reviewed in the NYRB. 

 

As the graph below shows, this proportion of NYRB writers getting reviews there only increases with more contributions, though it ceases to be significant past a certain threshold (i.e. fewer than 50 writers have written more than 55 reviews versus 2,101 who have written at least one review).

## A Boy’s Club?

In 1972, Elaine Reuben noted that approximately 10% of reviews and articles published in the NYRB from its founding to the summer of 1971 had been written by women and that six women had written half of the articles written by women.[[4\]](#_ftn4) More recently, an article in *The New York Times* about the announcement of the NYRB’s new editors cited an audit finding that about 23% of articles had been written by women, and one of the new editors noted that female representation was a priority for the NYRB.[[5\]](#_ftn5) The audit referenced is a count conducted by VIDA: Women in Literary Arts, which relies on volunteers counting by hand.[[6\]](#_ftn6) Cross-referencing article and review bylines with Social Security Administration baby name data yields  results without counting by hand.[[7\]](#_ftn7)

 

According to these data, 15.6% of all articles and reviews published in the NYRB have been written by women. Approximately 196 issues have featured no articles by women, while fewer than 6 issues have had 50% or more articles written by women.  While the trend towards a greater proportion of contributors being women over the history of the NYRB is statistically significant over the span of the NYRB’s history, in recent years it has been especially pronounced and represents a significant shift towards women’s participation.

## Overly Academic?

In his 1987 book*The Last Intellectuals* Russell Jacoby argued that the NYRB had moved from featuring so-called public intellectuals in favor of academics. He wrote:

The New York Review buzzed with energy and excitement during its first decade perhaps fueled by its intense crisscrossing relationships. Today, however, it looks very different. … it has refashioned its identity. For contributors the Review increasingly relies not on mere professors but on Ivy League professors, professors with titles and chairs, and especially professors from Oxford or Cambridge. Its few independent writers are old contributors like Gore Vidal and Theodore Draper. 

 

Blurb biographical data is available for 87% of authors of NYRB articles against which keywords such as “Harvard” and “professor” can be run to approximate the prevalence of these traits.

Looking at a moving average for keywords corresponding to Oxford/Cambridge, Ivy League schools, and general academic affiliation suggests that through the 1980s there was a general trend towards more academics in the 1980s when Jacoby wrote. This trend proves to be especially pronounced looking at the years 1970 to 1990.

What is perhaps the more significant observation here is that only nine issues in the NYRB’s history have not had a single academic contributor and in many issues academics represented the majority of contributors.

## Unwelcoming?

Jacoby and others have also been critical of the NYRB for not fostering new and young talent. I see three measures as serving as a proxy for measuring this, which I will consider in turn. They primarily indicate that the NYRB cultivated a base of long-standing contributors who represented a large part of the contributor-base. In recent years, contributors have increasingly been new to the NYRB and younger.

 

### The Ages of Contributors

Cross-referencing the names of contributors with Wikipedia yields birthdate data for authors of 58% of the NYRB’s articles (11,577 of 16,632). In turn, we can calculate the ages of these writers at the time of authoring any article. Except for in the past few years, the average age of NYRB contributors has steadily climbed.



![](/assets/Figures/5 Average NYRB Contributor Age.png)

 

### The Average And Median Tenure Of Contributors

Another indicator of the extent to which the NYRB has brought on newer writers is number of years for which any given contributor has been contributing. As shown below, on some level contributor tenure and the age of the NYRB itself are quite linked. Yet, even considering median tenure, which corrects for the potential of a handful of contributors with especially long tenures driving the number up, contributor tenure has only markedly declined in recent years.

 

![Chart](/assets/Figures/6 Tenure of NYRB Contributors.png)

### Proportion Of Contributors Who Are Writing In Their First Two Years At The NYRB

A more consistent indicator of the extent to which the NYRB has welcomed new writers is the proportion of articles written by contributors who are new to the NYRB, which I define as contributors who have contributed to the NYRB for a period of less than two years. As the chart below shows, starting in the mid-eighties, a much smaller proportion of articles were written by new contributors. Only in recent years has this number significantly increased.

 

![](/assets/Figures/7 Proportion of NYRB Articles Written by Newer Contributors.png)

### A New New York Review of Books?

A trend across the measures that have been discussed here is that all of the measures have changed considerably in recent years. While there is no one cause to which these changes can be attributed, the obvious one is that the generation that originally contributed to the NYRB has died. One thing that puts this generational change in stark relief is simply charting the percent of contributors who have been contributing since 1964 and the 1960s more generally over time.

![](/assets/Figures/8 Proportion of NYRB Articles Written by Contributors Who First Contributed in the 1960s.png)

We can also chart the proportion of articles written by contributors who started writing in a decade over time. It allows us to think about the contributors of the NYRB in terms of generations. Two things in particular stand out here. First, the generation of the 2000s is the first new generation since the 1970s generation of contributors to claim a larger proportion of contributions than the generation that preceded it. Second, the 2010s generation represents the largest infusion of new writers into the NYRB since the 1970s.

![](/assets/Figures/9 Distribution of NYRB Article Authorship by Decade When Contributors First Contributed.png)

Just who are these new writers? Looking at the measures we have thus far considered, what stands out most is that twice as many are women compared with the generation that preceded it.

## Conclusions 

None of the forgoing necessarily resolves the validity of any of the criticisms that have been leveled at the New York Review of Books over time. What truly matters about a journal of ideas is its actual substance: the writing. Yet these surface level data do in some rough way describe phenomena that do weigh on this substance. In particular, the extent to which the NYRBs writers are new to its pages is also some measure of the extent to which newer viewpoints also come to its pages.

What I consider to be the chief value of these descriptive statistics, however, is that they put many things that a reader of the NYRB might notice in isolation over the years into a broader perspective and with greater specificity. Just how many of those contributors teach at Ivy League schools? How many of them have been writing at the NYRB forever? And how many of those books are written by the same people?

 



###  **Appendix A: Methods**

 

#### Data 

The underlying data used here were collected by scraping metadata from every article categorized as a “Article or Review” in New York Review of Books’ online archive using the Python Beautiful Soup package. Specifically, for each article through August 2020, the following were collected: 

- The date of publication
- The name of the contributor
- The contributor’s biography (if it was available on the NYRB website)
- Details about books reviewed, including:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Page Count
  - Publisher
  - Cost

In turn all the contributor names were queried in WikiData, a machine readable website containing much of the metadata used on Wikipedia itself, using a Python module called WikiTools. I specifically collected information about birthdates, birthplaces, gender, and places of education.

 

Lastly, I used national baby name data from published by the Social Security Administration to code contributors by gender.[[1\]](#_ftn1) Specifically, for any given name, I assumed that the most common gender for a given name was the most likely indicator of a contributor’s gender. I elected to use the dataset corresponding to 1990 because it reflected an approximate midpoint in the years of the NYRB. In any instances where a contributor’s name was not in the SSA data (mainly when writers used initials such as W.H. Auden) I used gender data from WikiData if it was available.

 

#### Analysis

A profile of any contributor could be inferred using the data collected that included such features as when and how often they had contributed, their gender, their birthday, and whether they had written a book that was reviewed. A number of keywords about academic affiliation were also run against NYRB blurb bios to determine whether contributors were academics and whether they were affiliated with certain schools. In turn, this information about reviewers was cross referenced against the entire list of articles. This allowed other measures, such as the age of a writer at the time of writing to be calculated. 

 

Subsequently these data were aggregated on three levels: issue, year, and decade.

 

I tend to prefer looking at the data on the issue level because it reflects how the NYRB itself is experienced. However, most trends are only discernible in the broader aggregate of the year.

 

I used R to conduct simple statistical analysis to determine whether a number of trends were statistically significant using data at the issue level.
