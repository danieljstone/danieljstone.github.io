Welcome to my website! In this space I hope to look at:

* Available data on demographics and coronavirus fatalities in the District of Columbia.

* Walk sign timing algorithms in the District of Columbia.

* Whether criticisms by late 20th century intellectual historians of the *New York Review of Books* stand up to statistical analysis.

* The extent to which local coverage has declined in the *New York Times* by the numbers.
